# Animal Detection Comparison App

A Gradio-based web app for animal detection using two state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv8m and Faster R-CNN (Detectron2). Users can toggle between the models and upload images to see detection results.

## Models Used
- YOLOv8m (`best.pt`)
- Faster R-CNN (`model_final.pth`)

## Features
- Toggle between models
- Visual results with bounding boxes
- Real-time inference via Gradio

## Deployment
Hosted on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
